    "novel-py-calculator is a simple Python script that calculates the value of pi to a given number of digits by simulating collisions within a system of two masses and a wall. This \"algorithm\" is based off of the Youtube video by 3Blue1Brown, *The most unexpected answer to a counting puzzle*, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",

    "Above is a diagram of what the script is simulating. The simulation consists of two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, laying on a frictionless surface and an immovable wall to the left of the two masses. While the mass of $m_1$ is arbritrary, $m_2$'s mass is relative to $m_1$ and varies depending on the digits of pi that the script is to calculate. For a given number of digits of pi required $n$, the mass of $m_2$ is $10^{(2(n-1) + 1)} * m_1$. Simply put, the mass of \n",

    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "Due to the ten-fold increase in collisions simulated per extra digit of pi required (and thus compute time increasing by roughly a factor of ten per digit), It is inadvisable to attempt to calculate more than 8 digits of pi with this algorithm - average compute times fall well over twenty seconds.\n",
