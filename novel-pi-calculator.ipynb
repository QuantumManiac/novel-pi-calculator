    "novel-py-calculator is a simple Python script that calculates the value of pi to a given number of digits by simulating collisions within a system of two masses and a wall. This \"algorithm\" is based off of the Youtube video by 3Blue1Brown, *The most unexpected answer to a counting puzzle*, which can be found <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEfHFsfGXjs\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\n",

    "**The Algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Free-Body Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/xX7bNEq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is a diagram of what the script is simulating. The simulation consists of two masses, $m_1$ and $m_2$, situated on a frictionless surface, and an immovable wall to the left of the two masses. While the mass of $m_1$ is arbritrary, $m_2$'s mass is relative to $m_1$ and varies depending on the digits of pi that the script is to calculate. For a given number of digits of pi required $n$, the mass of $m_2$ is $m_1 * 10^{2n-1}$. For example, if $m_1$ is of mass 1, the simulation to calculate 3 digits of pi would require the mass of $m_2$ to be $10^5$. The velocity, $v_2$, of mass $m_2$ is arbritrary. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon running of the simulation, $m_2$ collides into $m_1$ at velocity $v_1$ in a perfectly elastic collision and sets the system in motion. From this, the two masses continute to collide with each other in perfectly elastic collisions. $m_1$ bounces off of the wall whenever the mass collides with it, completely reversing its velocity. Upon each collision a counter is incremented, which is later used to return the result. This simulation continues on until the system reaches a state in which all objects are no longer able to collide with each other due to their velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formulae used in calculating the resulting velocities from the elastic collisions in the simulation are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "${\\displaystyle {\\begin{array}{ccc}v_{1}&=&\\displaystyle {\\frac {m_{1}-m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{1}+{\\frac {2m_{2}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{2}\\\\[.5em]v_{2}&=&\\displaystyle {\\frac {2m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{1}+{\\frac {m_{2}-m_{1}}{m_{1}+m_{2}}}u_{2}\\end{array}}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $u_1$ and $u_2$ and the pre-collision velocities of the colliding masses\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the simulation is completed, the value of pi can be calculated by taking the number of collisions between objects in the system and multiplying it by $10^{n - 1}$, where $n$ is the digits of pi the script is calculating.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the ten-fold increase in collisions simulated per extra digit of pi required (and thus compute time increasing by roughly a factor of ten per digit), It is inadvisable to attempt to calculate more than 8 digits of pi with this algorithm - average compute times fall well over twenty seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows the average process time for the Python script for digits of pi ranging from 1 to 8. Results may vary for your own computer. \n",
